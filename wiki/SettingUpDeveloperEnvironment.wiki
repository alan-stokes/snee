#summary This page describes how to set up the developer environment for the new version of SNEE.

= Tools Installation =

 * Install a Subversion Client
  * http://subversion.tigris.org/

 * Install Maven
  * http://maven.apache.org/

 * Install Eclipse
  * http://www.eclipse.org/downloads

 * Install Eclipse Plugins
  * Subclipse (for SVN support)
    * http://subclipse.tigris.org/
  * m2eclipse (for Maven support, including the extras)
    * http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/installing-m2eclipse.html

= Obtain and Build the Source Code =

 * Configure Maven
  * settings.xml in ~/.m2
   * On lines 127 and 133 add your techideas username
   * On lines 128 and 134 add your password

 * Using the SVN Repository Browser in Eclipse, add the Google SVN URL to your list of SVN repositories:
   * https://snee.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
   * (this is accessed using your google username and password)
   * Right-click on snee folder, and select ‘Check out as Maven Project’.  Follow the steps; this will result in a project named 'compiler' in the workspace. (Unfortunately, it is not possible to change the name of the project due to maven; the workaround is to have multiple workspaces in Eclipse)
