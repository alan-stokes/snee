= Getting Started =

This page explains how to install SNEE and get it running, and is aimed at mainly at users.  Note that SNEE developers are directed to the [Installing_Developer_Environment instructions for SNEE developers].

===Dependencies===
 * Java SDK 1.5 or newer
 * antlr (2.7.5 is recommended).  This is included in the zip file.
 * GraphViz (I've got version 2.20.2 for the Mac, 2.20.3 had a bug and does not work)

===Installation===

 # Download the latest release from the [http://code.google.com/p/snee/downloads/list downloads section], and unzip it to the directory of your choice.
 # Cd into the SNEE folder and create folders named bin and output if they are not already there.
 # Compile the Java source code:
{{{
     > javac -sourcepath src -classpath "src;lib/antlr-2.7.5.jar" src/uk/ac/manchester/cs/diasmc/querycompiler/QueryCompiler.java -d bin
}}}
 # In the input folder, make a copy of example-local.ini and rename it to local.ini.  You the need to edit the file and fill in the path of the GraphViz executable.
{{{
[GraphViz]
#Location of the GraphViz executable
exe = c:/Program Files/Graphviz2.20/bin/dot.exe
}}}
