#summary How to install SNEE and get it running quickly.

= Getting Started =

This page explains how to install SNEE and get it running, and is aimed at mainly at users.  Note that SNEE developers are directed to the [Installing_Developer_Environment instructions for SNEE developers].

===Dependencies===
 * Java SDK 1.5 or newer
 * antlr (2.7.5 is recommended).  This is included in the zip file.
 * GraphViz (I've got version 2.20.2 for the Mac, 2.20.3 had a bug and does not work)

===Installation===

 # Download the latest release from the [http://code.google.com/p/snee/downloads/list downloads section], and unzip it to the directory of your choice.
 # Cd into the SNEE folder and create folders named *bin* and *output* if they are not already there.
 # Compile the Java source code:
{{{
	> javac -sourcepath src -classpath "src:lib/antlr-2.7.5.jar" \
          src/uk/ac/manchester/cs/diasmc/querycompiler/QueryCompiler.java \
          -d bin
}}}
 # In the input folder, make a copy of example-local.ini and rename it to local.ini.  You the need to edit the file and fill in the path of the GraphViz executable.
{{{
	[GraphViz]
	#Location of the GraphViz executable
	exe = c:/Program Files/Graphviz2.20/bin/dot.exe
}}}

===Running the query optimizer===

You can run the java source code without any parameters (in which case default values are used)
{{{
	> java -classpath "bin;src;lib/antlr-2.7.5.jar" uk.ac.manchester.cs.diasmc.querycompiler.QueryCompiler
}}}

The query plan and code generated by SNEE is written the output folder.

Some of the most common SNEE parameters are:

 * *-query=**<file*>
the file containing the query text to be optimized  
 * *-schema-file=**<file*>
The file containing the physical schema to be used, which specifies which nodes are the sources of the streams being queried, and the sink node.
 * *-network-topology-file=**<file*>
The file describing the network topology.
 * *-qos-acquisition-interval=**<val_in_ms*>
The rate at which sensor readings should be acquired, in milliseconds.
 * *-qos-max-delivery-time=**<val_in_ms*>
the maximum permissable delivery time for query results, in millseconds.
	
All filenames may be specified in a relative or absolute manner.  There are example queries, physical schemas annd networks in the input subdirectory of the SNEE release. The contents of the subdirectories of input directory are as follows:

 * Hilltop: Contains the queries/physical schema for the environmental monitoring scenario used in our ICDE'08 paper.
 * Pipes: Contains the queries/physical schema for the pipe-monitoring scenario used in our SSDBM paper.
 * Building: Contains the queries and physical schema for a building monitoring scenario.  
 * Networks: Contains various network topology files, for networks of varying size, area and layouts (e.g., grid/random.)
