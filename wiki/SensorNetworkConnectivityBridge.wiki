= Installing the Metadata Collector Image on the Nodes =

  * Do the non-basestation nodes first:
  * Change to nesC/MetadataCollector directory
  * make telosb install,< node_id >

  * For the basestation:
  * Change to nesC/MetadataCollectorBasestation directory
  * make telosb install,< basestation_id >

= Details =

  * init
    * Forms the network and collects metadata.
    * init < topology_file > < basestation_id >
  * register
    * Installs an image to a specific node.
    * register < image absoulute path >  < dest node id >  < basestation_id >
  * start
    * Initiates query execution.
    * takes no parameters
  * stop
    * Stops query execution.
    * stop < basestation id >
  * deregister
    * Uninstalls a query image on a specific node.
    * deregister < id1 > < id2 > ... < idn > < basestation_id >
