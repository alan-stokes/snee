This page describes the commands used by the Sensor Network Connectivity Bridge.

= Install the OTA tool into the Nodes' External Flash Memory =

  * First, manually with a cable, add OTAServer to the non-basestation nodes, and OTABasestation to the basestation.
  {{{ make telosb install,<node_id> }}}

  * Then install the OTA image into each node
  {{{ tos-ota <source> <destination> <-p|-i|-r|-e> image_number }}}
  * {{{<source>}}} is the serial port, e.g., serial@/dev/tty.usbserial-USB0:115200
  * {{{<destination>}}}
= Installing the Metadata Collector Image on the Nodes' Program Memory =

  * Do the non-basestation nodes first:
  * Change to nesC/MetadataCollector directory
  * make telosb install,< node_id >

  * For the basestation:
  * Change to nesC/MetadataCollectorBasestation directory
  * make telosb install,< basestation_id >

= Details =

  * init
    * This needs the metadata collector installed on the nodes' program memory.
    * Forms the network and collects metadata.
    * init < topology_file > < basestation_id >
  * register
    * Installs an image to a specific node.
    * register < image absoulute path >  < dest node id >  < basestation_id >
  * start
    * Initiates query execution.
    * takes no parameters
  * stop
    * Stops query execution.
    * stop < basestation id >
  * deregister
    * Uninstalls a query image on a specific node.
    * deregister < id1 > < id2 > ... < idn > < basestation_id >
