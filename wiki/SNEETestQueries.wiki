===Select * Query===

{{{
"SELECT * FROM SeaDefence[NOW];" 120 "etc/query-parameters.xml"
}}}

===Select attributes without aliases Query===

{{{
"SELECT s.seaLevel FROM SeaDefence[NOW] s;" 120
"etc/query-parameters.xml"
}}}

===Select attributes with aliases Query===

{{{
"SELECT s.seaLevel as sl FROM SeaDefence[NOW] s;" 120
"etc/query-parameters.xml"
}}}


===Select attribute without alias and expression with alias Query===

{{{
"SELECT seaLevel, (s.seaLevel + 2) as sl FROM SeaDefence[NOW] s;" 120
"etc/query-parameters.xml"
}}}

===Select attribute without alias and expression without alias Query===

{{{
"SELECT seaLevel, (s.seaLevel + 2) FROM SeaDefence[NOW] s;" 120
"etc/query-parameters.xml"
}}}

===Join Query with alias in SELECT clause===

{{{
"SELECT e.sealevel as x, w.sealevel as y 
FROM SeaDefenceEast[NOW] e, SeaDefenceWest[NOW] w;" 
120 "etc/query-parameters.xml"
}}}

Doesn't work with alias on outer query due to issue 28.

===Join Query without alias in SELECT clause===

{{{
"SELECT e.sealevel, w.sealevel FROM SeaDefenceEast[NOW] e, SeaDefenceWest[NOW] w;" 120 "etc/query-parameters.xml"
}}}

works!

===Linear Regression Query===

{{{
"SELECT sd.sealevel, lr.a * sd.sealevel + lr.b FROM
   (SELECT    (T.n*S.sum_xy - T.sum_y * T.sum_x ) / ( T.n * T.sum_sqr_x - T.sum_x * T.sum_x ) as a,        
      ( T.sum_y * T.sum_sqr_x - T.sum_x * T.sum_xy ) / ( T.n * T.sum_sqr_x - T.sum_x * T.sum_x ) as b 
   FROM (SELECT COUNT( S.sealevel) as n, SUM( S.sv ) as sum_xy, 
      SUM( S.sealevel ) as sum_x, SUM(S.voltage ) as sum_y, SUM(S.sealevel * S.sealevel ) as sum_sqr_x    
         FROM ( SELECT seaLevel, voltage, seaLevel*voltage as sv 
            FROM SeaDefenceEast[FROM NOW TO NOW SLIDE 5000 seconds] ) S ) T ) lr, 
   seadefence[now] sd;" 120 "etc/query-parameters.xml"
}}}

Doesn't work with alias on outer query due to issue 28.
