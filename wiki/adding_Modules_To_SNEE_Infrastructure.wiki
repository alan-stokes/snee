This is a hopefully best standard behaviour for dealing with adding new modules to the SNEE infrastructure. 


=Adding module=  
(tips to keep sure you don't add or miss the wrong stuff into the svn)

1. Its safer to port a old module and rename its artifact id, name and descriptions within its pom. 
2. You need to update the main SNEE pom with the new module name (the artifact id of the module from point 1).
3. you need to add the new modules directory to the svn (*but avoiding any of the auto generated files like target directory, .settings, .protect etc.*)
4. commit new module to svn. 
5. send a mail out to the rest of the developing team announcing the addition of the module.

=gaining modules from merges= 
(tips to keep sure you actually get the modules)

1. merge the revisions which give you the new module.
2. commit your new merged branch to the svn.
3. remove your copy of the branch from your local area (needed for eclipse to detect the new module).
4. pull your branch off the svn repos, if all is good and worked, you should find the new module appears in your new local version.
