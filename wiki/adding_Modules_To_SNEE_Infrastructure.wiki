#summary This page describes the process in adding and acquiring new modules from/in to the SNEE infrastructure.

= Introduction =

This is a hopefully best standard behaviour for dealing with adding new modules to the SNEE infrastructure. 


=Adding module=  
(tips to keep sure you don't add or miss the wrong stuff into the svn)

  # Its safer to create a new module from scratch with new-other-maven-module (porting a copy of a current module will cause many problems with maven) but its easier and safer to copy the pom file and altering its artifiact id, etc.
  # You need to update the main SNEE pom with the new module name (the artifact id of the module from point 1).
  # you need to add the new modules directory to the svn (*but avoiding any of the auto generated files like target directory, .settings, .protect etc.*)
  # right click on your module and click share. This allows it to be downloaded off the repos.
  # commit new module to svn. 
  # send a mail out to the rest of the developing team announcing the addition of the module.

=gaining modules from merges= 
(tips to keep sure you actually get the modules)

  # merge the revisions which give you the new module.
  # commit your new merged branch to the svn.
  # remove your copy of the branch from your local area (needed for eclipse to detect the new module).
  # pull your branch off the svn repos, if all is good and worked, you should find the new module appears in your new local version.
